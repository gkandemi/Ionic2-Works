Ever since college-bound Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) was a little monster, he’s dreamed of becoming a Scarer—and he knows better than anyone that the best Scarers come from Monsters University (MU). But during his first semester at MU, Mike’s plans are derailed when he crosses paths with hotshot James P. Sullivan, “Sulley” (John Goodman), a natural-born Scarer. The pair’s out-of-control competitive spirit gets them both kicked out of the University’s elite Scare Program. With their dreams temporarily dashed, they realize they will have to work together, along with an odd bunch of misfit monsters, if they ever hope to make things right."

With habitat neighborhoods like ritzy Sahara Square and frigid Tundratown, it’s a melting pot where animals from every environment live together—a place where no matter what you are, from the biggest elephant to the smallest shrew, you can be anything. But when optimistic Officer Judy Hopps arrives, she discovers that being the first bunny on a police force of big, tough animals isn’t so easy. Determined to prove herself, she jumps at the opportunity to crack a case, even if it means partnering with fast-talking scam-artist fox Nick Wilde to solve the mystery."

Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award® nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972."

Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings -- In the conclusion of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings, as armies mass for a final battle that will decide the fate of the world -- and powerful, ancient forces of Light and Dark compete to determine the outcome -- one member of the Fellowship of the Ring is revealed as the noble heir to the throne of the Kings of Men. Yet, the sole hope for triumph over evil lies with a brave hobbit, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood - \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" \"Everything is Illuminated\"), who, accompanied only by his loyal friend Sam and the hiddeous, wretched Gollum, ventures deep into the very dark heart of Mordor on his seemingly impossible quest to destroy the Ring of Power. Also starring Academy Award-nominee Viggo Mortensen (\"A History of Violence,\" \"Eastern Promises\"), Academy Award-nominee and Golden Globe-winner Ian McKellan (\"X-Men,\" TV's \"Rasputin\"), Orlando Bloom (\"Troy,\" \"The Pirates of the Caribbean” trilogy), Liv Tyler (\"The Strangers\" \"The Incredible Hulk\") and Academy Award and Golden Globe-winner Cate Blanchett (\"Elizabeth,\" \"The Aviator\").

Coppola tells two stories in Part II: the roots and rise of a young Don Vito, played with uncanny ability by Robert De Niro, and the ascension of Michael (Al Pacino) as the new Don. Reassembling many of the talents who helped make The Godfather, Coppola has produced a movie of staggering magnitude and vision, and undeniably the best sequel ever made. Robert De Niro won an Oscar; the film received six Academy Awards, including Best Picture of 1974."

An action-packed, epic space adventure, Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy” expands the Marvel Cinematic Universe into the cosmos, where brash adventurer Peter Quill finds himself the object of an unrelenting bounty hunt after stealing a mysterious orb coveted by Ronan, a powerful villain with ambitions that threaten the entire universe. To evade the ever-persistent Ronan, Quill is forced into an uneasy truce with a quartet of disparate misfits—Rocket, a gun-toting raccoon, Groot, a tree-like humanoid, the deadly and enigmatic Gamora and the revenge-driven Drax the Destroyer. But when Quill discovers the true power of the orb and the menace it poses to the cosmos, he must do his best to rally his ragtag rivals for a last, desperate stand—with the galaxy’s fate in the balance."

He learns the hard way that no good deed goes unpunished when he tries to help out some local teens and winds up getting jumped by a trio of gutter punks. Stealing his stash and his cash, they leave him in major debt to his supplier, Brad. In order to wipe the slate clean—and maintain a clean bill of health—David must now become a big-time drug smuggler by bringing Brad's latest shipment in from Mexico. Twisting the arms of his neighbors, cynical stripper Rose and wannabe customer Kenny, and the tatted-and-pierced streetwise teen Casey, he devises a foolproof plan. One fake wife, two pretend kids and a huge, shiny RV later, the \"Millers\" are headed south of the border for a Fourth of July weekend that is sure to end with a bang."

But, in the midst of the chaos, six Americans manage to slip away and find refuge in the home of Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor. Knowing it is only a matter of time before the six are found out and likely killed, the Canadian and American governments ask the CIA to intervene. The CIA turns to their top \"exfiltration\" specialist, Tony Mendez, to come up with a plan to get the six Americans safely out of the country. A plan so incredible, it could only happen in the movies."

        "longDescription": "After taking moviegoers magically into the realm of toys, bugs, monsters, fish, and superheroes, the masterful storytellers and technical wizards at Pixar Animation Studios, and Academy Award®-winning director John Lasseter (Toy Story, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life), hit the road with a fast-paced comedy adventure set inside the world of cars. Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), a hotshot rookie race car driven to succeed, discovers that life is about the journey, not the finish line, when he finds himself unexpectedly detoured in the sleepy Route 66 town of Radiator Springs. On route across the country to the big Piston Cup Championship in California to compete against two seasoned pros, Lightning McQueen gets to know the town's offbeat characters –including Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), and a rusty but trusty tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) – who help him realize that there are more important things than trophies, fame and sponsorship. The all-star vocal cast also includes free-wheeling performances by Tony Shalhoub, Michael Keaton, George Carlin, Katherine Helmond, Cheech Marin, John Ratzenberger, Paul Dooley, Michael Wallis, Darrell Waltrip, racing legend Richard Petty, Jenifer Lewis and Jeremy Piven. Fueled with plenty of humor, action, heartfelt drama, and amazing new technical feats, Cars is a high octane delight for moviegoers of all ages."

        "longDescription": "Nominated for eight (8) Academy Awards, this acclaimed film broke stigmas for mood disorders in a raw, exuberant and ultimately triumphant story of misfit love, family and community. Set specifically in a Philadelphia neighborhood (based on Matthew Quick’s novel), Oscar-nominated Bradley Cooper surprised, moved, and captivated audiences in his portrayal of Pat Solatano, a man who returns from eight (8) months of enforced time in a mental hospital to put his life back together.  Jennifer Lawrence dazzled — and won the 2012 Academy Award for Best Actress — as the tough and inspired neighborhood girl recovering from her own tragedies.  She synchronized with gem performances by fellow Academy Award nominees Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver who created an emotional household unlike any other in film built upon this father's superstitious bookmaking on Philadelphia Eagles games.  With a stellar cast rounded out by Chris Tucker, John Ortiz, Anupam Kehr, Shea Whigham, and Julia Stiles, the film was singled out by US Senators in Washington seeking parity for mental health treatment and services.  The film is a surprising story as heartfelt as it is comedic and enchanting."

But his peaceful existence is shattered when three hit men show up in his house, and Frank must call on every ounce of his past training to escape with his life. Knowing that whoever’s trying to kill him will likely target those he cares for, Frank snatches Sarah from her home and flees, struggling to stay one step ahead of his deadly pursuers. But when Frank and Sarah begin digging into the identity of his attackers, they discover Frank is on a hit list along with several of his former CIA cohorts—and that the organization ordering the killings is none other than the Agency itself. Someone at the CIA wants him dead. But who? And why? Going on the offensive, Frank rounds up an unlikely crew of his past agency sidekicks, including the paranoid Marvin, the loyal Joe and the lovely Victoria. With the Agency hot on their trails, Frank and his team must do everything they can to solve the mystery before it’s too late—and hopefully instil in their assailants some of the old-school code of honor by which they still choose to live."
